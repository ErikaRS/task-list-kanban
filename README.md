# Task List Kanban

The Task List Kanban is a free and open source Obsidian plugin that automatically imports all your 'tasks' within obsidian files into a kanban view. This plugin was created to reduce duplication of effort when managing and prioritising tasks. Any time you have a task that needs to be done, simply note it down using the 'task' format in an obsidian file, and it will automatically appear in your Task List Kanban - it's that easy!

By adding tags to your tasks using '#', you can allocate tasks to specific columns in your kanban, as well as add additional tags that you can use to filter. From the kanban view, you can easily move your tasks between columns, archive tasks, apply or change filters, and even jump straight to the file where the task sits. Any change made to a task from the kanban view will also update the task in its file, and visa versa.

### Setting up your kanban & managing columns

You'll want to set up the columns that you want to appear in your kanban, including the number of columns.

xxxxx

You will be able to rename/add/remove these columns at anytime. However! Please think carefully when naming your columns, as any tasks you add to that column will be associated with the exact column name. This means that if you change a column name in the future, all the tasks associated with the old version of that column will end up in 'uncategorised'. They are NOT automatically applied to the new naming of the column.

### Adding a task to your kanban

Create a 'task' in any Obsidian file. You can do this by highlighting any text, right clicking, and then selling Paragraph > Task list.

This task will now automatically appear in your kanban, under the 'Uncategorised' column. (Note this Uncategorised column will only display if you have uncategorised tasks.)

To place the task in a column you have two choices to do this:

1. From within the Obsidian file, add text to the task that reads '#[name of column]'
2. From within the Kanban view, drag the task from uncategorised to whichever column you desire. This will automatically add to the task file the text, '#[name of column]'

The text '#[name of column]' will not be visible in the kanban view, so it won't clog up your tasks!
You can only assign each task to one column within your kanban.

### Managing tasks within your kanban

From within the kanban view, you have a range of options when managing your tasks.

**Editing tasks**
You can edit the text of your tasks, as well as add or edit any tags, from within the kanban view. Click the task text and start editing! This will update the task within its file also.

**Moving tasks between columns**
To move tasks between kanban columns, either drag and drop the task, or click the task's settings icon and select the desired column.

**Archive tasks**
You can archive any tasks by clicking the task's settings icon, and choosing archive. This will xxxxxxx

**Done column**
The final column in the kanban has an additional settings menu. This allows you to quickly and easily delete/archive all tasks within this column. The idea is that if tasks have made it to this column, they have been completed, and you will likely want to delete or archive these completed tasks at some stage!

### Tagging tasks & filtering tasks within your kanban

You may wish to add tags to tasks in order to enable filtering within your kanban. For example, you could add a tag with the name of the project it relates to, which would allow you to then filter your kanban by project name.

**Tagging a task**
To add a tag to a task, add the text, '#[tag name]' to anywhere within your task. If you have created this tag previously, you will be prompted to autocomplete the tag with that text. This '#[tag name]' will be visible within the kanban view as well as the text file.
